We also have a terrific life insurance plan from our employer as\nwell. We aren't wealthy, but we do make enough money to get taxed\nthrough the nose and we've done a good job living modestly and debt\nfree. I'm considering cash value life insurance, which I know you\naren't a big fan of, but the more I look at the numbers the more it\nseems to make sense since the options I have are after tax\ninvestments.

They do this to lure you into a policy.
